NEWS 28/06/2021 *** XCLOUD PC IS OPEN FOR ALL *** NEWS 28/06/2021

Xcloud is the new platform of Cloud Gaming by Microsoft Xbox. 
The official App, exist only for Smartphone and Tablets Android at the moment,  and this is limited at the resolution 720p. 

I'm a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud Web App for PC: It's exectuted directly from the browser  on PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). 
I have the project to enjoy it directly on my box TV : The Nvidia shield Pro 2019.
So i decided to coding an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games of my gamepass ultimate.

NEWS 28/06/2021 *** XCLOUD PC IS OPEN FOR ALL *** NEWS 28/06/2021

NO UNOFFICIAL PHYSICAL ACCESSORIES CONNECTED

Know Issue : When a physical keyboard or remote not official (not from nvidia, like harmony) are connected, the controller is blocked.
Edit V4 :
It was true before the method about EKH "External Keyboard Helper", because this app authorise external keyboards and remapping.

REMAPPING THE BUTTON BACK/SELECT

The major issue was the select/back button acting in the shield like a back to the home.
