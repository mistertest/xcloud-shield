![Xcloud_beta_home_icon](https://github.com/mistertest/xcloud-shield/blob/master/img/banner_xcloud_beta_app.png)


 #### WORLD PREMIERE !
 
 Yes I can say that, welcome to my Xcloud Beta for Android TV


## CONTEXT


Xcloud is the new Cloud Gaming Platform by Microsoft Xbox.<br>
Xcloud was on private beta, during some months, and it's public now for all from the 28 June 2O21 ago.

#### Why I created Xcloud App Unofficial for Shield TV ?

I was a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud Web App for PC <br>
It's exectuted directly from the browser on PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). <br>
I was thinking that it will be awesome if I can enjoy it directly on my box TV : The Nvidia shield Pro 2019.<br>
So I decided to coding, an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games of my "game pass ultimate".<br>
It was a good idea and excited project, for improve my skills in Android App development.

#### Why I not use "Sideload" or browsers ?


The official Android app only exists for smartphones and tablets at the moment, so there is no official Android TV app at this time. <br>
You can only use "Sideload" with the Smartphone App version, but the performance <br>
was not optimized at the start of the service, and the interface was not designed and integrated for the Android TV experience. <br>
In fact, the Official game pass app has made a lot of improvements, and now the experience is better.<br>
But it was not the case 6 month ago and my app was born from this frustrating situation.  <br><br>
Despite the progress made by the official Application Game Pass, <br>
I continue to having preferences for many aspects of my Application <br>
such as the interface, the smoothness of navigation, the overall image rendering and a better experience in Game for me.<br>
So this App is an Alternative choice for having another experience Xbox Cloud Gaming directly in your Shield TV.






### SUPPORTED DEVICES
-------------------

I have a shield TV Pro version 2019.

- All Nvidia shield tv box (2015,2017 to Pro 2019)
- Perhaps certain models of latest and powerfull Firestck, Firecube and Mi box
- Perhaps certain latest models of TV

Globally all Android TV device powerful ( Processor, APU, RAM ) can run and provide the better experience.
Certain users install it on powerful smartphone, and have a very good experience too.
But it's firstly for the shield TV, the most powerful Android device, it's not a myth.


This App is not supported for the Chromecast Google TV.
A special project for this device will be coming here soon:
https://github.com/mistertest/xcloud-cgtv


### SUPPORTED CONTROLLERS
------------------------

All controllers supported by the shield TV officialy.

I recommend to use "Xbox" controllers, because "Xinput" the mapping from Microsoft is the more integrated and optimised for all things about Cloud Gaming and Android by default.

- All Shield TV conrollers version (version 2019 tested)
- Latest version Xbox One /Series X controller (tested serie x with latest update)
- Logitech F710 (tested)
- The majority of "Xinput" controllers

New with te Version 4.4 : 
The Version 4.4 give now the priority to Xbox controllers for interacting in Game when multiple Controllers are connceted at the same time.
Others Controllers are not disconnected, they can't interact in game but only with the Android TV navigation.
When the xbox controller is disconnected, the other controller already connected can be use in game automaticly.



### REQUIREMENTS
-------------

##### NO UNOFFICIAL PHYSICAL ACCESSORIES CONNECTED

Know Issue : When a physical keyboard or remote not official (not from nvidia, like harmony) are connected, the controller is blocked.


##### REMAPPING THE BUTTON BACK/SELECT
