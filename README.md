![Xcloud_beta_home_icon](https://github.com/mistertest/xcloud-shield/blob/master/img/banner_xcloud_beta_app.png)


 "World Premiere !"
 
 Yes i can say that, welcome to my Xcloud Beta for Android TV


## Context

Xcloud is the new Cloud Gaming Platform by Microsoft Xbox.
Xcloud was on private beta, during some months, and it's public now for all from the 28 June 2O21 ago.


The official Android App, exist only for Smartphone and Tablets at the moment, so there is no official App for Android TV, for now.
You can only use "Sideload" with  the Smartphone App, but performances are not optimized and the Interface is not thinked and integrated for Android TV experience.

I was a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud Web App for PC: It's exectuted directly from the browser  on PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). 
I was thinking that it will be awesome if i can enjoy it directly on my box TV : The Nvidia shield Pro 2019.
So i decided to coding, an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games of my "game pass ultimate".
It was a good idea and excited project, for improve my skills in Android App development.




### Supported Devices
-------------------

I have a shield TV Pro version 2019.

- All Nvidia shield tv box (2015,2017 to Pro 2019)
- All latest models Xiaomi Mi box TV ( Mi box 4S/PRO)
- All latest models of Firestick and Firecube from Amazon
- Perhaps certain latest models of TV

Globally all Android TV device powerful ( Processor, APU, RAM ) can run and provide the better experience.
Certain users install it on powerful smartphone, and have a very good experience too.
But it's firstly for the shield TV, the most powerful Android device, it's not a myth.


This App is not supported for the Chromecast Google TV.
A special project for this device will be coming here soon:

### Supported Controllers
------------------------

All controllers supported by the shield TV officialy.

I don't recommend PS4/5 controllers, because "Xinput " the mapping from Microsoft is the more integrated and optimised for all things about Cloud Gaming and Android by default. You'll have to using obscur tricks for just having a correct experience with your Playstation controler.

NO UNOFFICIAL PHYSICAL ACCESSORIES CONNECTED

Know Issue : When a physical keyboard or remote not official (not from nvidia, like harmony) are connected, the controller is blocked.
Edit V4 :
It was true before the method about EKH "External Keyboard Helper", because this app authorise external keyboards and remapping.

REMAPPING THE BUTTON BACK/SELECT

The major issue was the select/back button acting in the shield like a back to the home.
